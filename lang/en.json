Per QL a new skill (player’s choice whether combat skill, medical skill or general skill) is revealed or the level of the skill is revealed.",
    "LAST STAND": "After receiving lethal damage and while your heart rate is >100/>60 you become immobilised instead of unconscious.

After your HR falls below the threshold you are following the common rules for dying. Can be combined with 'unfinished business'.",
    "LEADER": "Your behaviour instils confidence in your peers. You can combine a Cha check with a physical proficiency check.

If both the communication and the skill check fail others get disadvantage on their rolls.<br />At level 2 a successful communication suffices to give others advantage and they never gain disadvantage from you.

After a successful aimed shot with a blaster, pistol, shotgun, slug thrower, or SABs you can perform a Crd check. Upon success the next aimed shot on the same target will only costs one action.
